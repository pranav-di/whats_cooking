# whats_cooking
Kaggle what's cooking competition code code.
The project contains a jupyter notebook which implements code for Kaggle's what's cooking competition.
The notebook contains implementation using 6 machine learning algorithms for classifying the recipes into cuisines. The aim of this project was to study the performance of these machine learning algorithms based on their prediction accuracy.
The scores received were not published on the public scoreboard as the competition has ended but top performing models would have been  ranked 17/1338 (SVM) and 39/1338 (Neural Network).
